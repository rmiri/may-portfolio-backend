This is the backend for my final project for the Software Engineering BootCamp at FlatIron London.
The project is a portfolio website for image-based professionals (designers, photographersâ€¦), you can see a live demo [here](https://vimeo.com/402325147).

The Interface Design was done by [May Miriuk](https://www.maymiriuk.com/).

I used Ruby on Rails for the backend and React.Js and redux for the frontend.
